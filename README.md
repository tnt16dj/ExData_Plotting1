## Introduction

This repository contains the necessary code to complete Exploratory Data Analysis Course Project 1.  The repo contains 5 total scripts:

* <b>Main.r</b> - handles the downloading of the source data, any relevant packages that may need to be installed, and handles the calls to each of the four plotting scripts.
* <b>plot1.r</b> - creates the histogram required in plot 1.
* <b>plot2.r</b> - creates the line plot required in plot 2.
* <b>plot3.r</b> - creates the multi-line plot required in plot 3.
* <b>plot4.r</b> - creates the multi-plot plots required in plot 4.

You can simply source <b>Main.r</b> into your working directory and it will download the necessary data, install lubridate, source each of the four plotting scripts, execute the plotting scripts, and save the resulting plots to your hard drive.

The <b>Main.r</b> script creates the following file structure in your working directory:
* ExData_Plotting1
 * My_Plots
 * My_Scripts
 * Power_Data


Here is the output of the Main.r script for quick reference:
